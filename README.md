This is just the vimrc file that I use, threw it up here so I can pull it onto any servers I'm on easily, if you happen to find it useful awesome. Oh and there's a simple bash script that sets up pathogen for you and then clones in a bunch of cool plugins off of git and stores them in bundle so they're ready to go, and sets you up with the spring-night colorscheme. If you don't use the script the vimrc will bitch at you every time you open vim because it can't find the colorscheme, just fyi.
